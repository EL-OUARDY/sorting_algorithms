# Sorting algorithms & Big O — Alx Higher Level Programming
0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Introduction
Sorting is the process of arranging items in a specific order, like numerical or alphabetical. we have many different algorithms help in achieving this task efficiently.

## Common Sorting Algorithms
- **Bubble Sort**: It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort**: It divides the list into sorted and unsorted parts, iteratively selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and adds it to the sorted part.
- **Insertion Sort**: It builds the sorted list one item at a time by shifting larger elements to the right to make space for the current item.
- **Merge Sort**: It's a <ins>divide-and-conquer</ins> algorithm that divides the list into smaller parts, sorts them individually, and merges them back together in order.
- **Quick Sort**: It also uses the <ins>divide-and-conquer</ins> strategy by picking an element as a pivot, partitioning the list around the pivot, and recursively sorting the sublists.

## Why Sorting Algorithms?
Learning about sorting algorithms helps in choosing the right one for specific tasks. Some are faster for smaller lists, while others are more efficient for larger datasets.

## Big O Notation
`Big O notation` helps in understanding how the time or space required by an algorithm grows as the input size increases. It guides in picking the most suitable algorithm based on the input size to optimize performance.
### Key Points:
- `O(1)`: Constant time (ideal); it doesn’t change with the input size.
- `O(n)`: Linear time; grows linearly with the input size.
- `O(log n)`: Logarithmic time; increases slowly as the input size grows.
- `O(n log n)`: Log-linear time; slightly faster than linear growth.
- `O(n²)`: Quadratic time; grows rapidly with the input size.

## Conclusion
Sorting algorithms play a crucial role in organizing data efficiently. Big O notation serves as a handy tool to understand and compare algorithm performance, aiding programmers in writing faster and more efficient code.
